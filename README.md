# [Russia has taken the lead in a space race with a difference](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58804143), sending a team to the International Space Station to shoot a feature film ahead of an American crew.

Yulia Peresild, *37*, is set to star in the film, directed by Klim Shipenko.
Their Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft took off from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, and three hours later docked with the International Space Station.
US actor Tom Cruise and Nasa have also been planning to make a film there.

There was more than a touch of show business glamour when the Soyuz crew launched on Tuesday, as the TV cameras focused on Peresild and her 12-year-old daughter Anna, who was watching from a safe distance.
